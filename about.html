                                        Accounts about the first descendants and therefore of Yoruba dynasties differ from place to place. 
                                        In his account in “The History of the Yorubas” the distinguised historian and author, Samuel Johnson, 
                                        enumerates the seven grandchildren of Oduduwa and founder of the SeniorYoruba Dynasties as: <br><br>
                                        (1)	A Princess (IYUN ADE) who was the mother of Owu's <br>
                                        (2)	Akinsua of Benin <br>

                                                                The first Olowu of Owu, being the son of a Princess, derived his royalty by virtue of his maternal descent from Oduduwa and therefore acquired the right to wear a crown like his uncles in rather unusual circumstances. The story as recorded by Samuel Johnson is that when Olowu was a child,
                                                                 he often played on his grandfather’s laps while the old man wore his crown. In one such childish pranks, the child pulled at the crown and his indulgent grandfather placed it on his head much to the delight of the child. When attempts were made later to take the crown back, the child was said to 
                                                                 have cried so much that the grandfather directed that the boy be allowed to keep it. Thus, the first Olowu came to,be called ASUNKUNGBADE (One who cried to secure a crown). This story is accepted by generations of surviving Own Communities to date that the first Olowu wasAsunkungbade, hence the name 
                                                                 becoming one of the appelations (oriki) of all Owus.
                                                                It is interesting to note that wherever Olowu’s children went to establish settlements, they went with Beaded Crown and are generally referred to as Olowus with the appelations (Omo) sons toAjibosin to indicate that they all have common ancestors “Oba Ajibosin”, founder and first Olowu ofOwu Dynasty.

                                                                                        Akindele Anlugbua left Owu Ipole as a result of personal ambition to establish a kingdom for himself. <br> <br>

                                                                                         He fought several wars with tremendous success for Owu people with the historical consequence that Own people becametarget of envy and hatred of their neighbouring towns and villages.
                                                                                          It was in one of such wars that his horse stepped on ‘skin’ peeled off from yarns and thus slipped down while it also fell on the cover of groundnuts. As a result, 
                                                                                          the selling of pounded yarn and groundnut by any o is ona desonsartd8aughterswithioKutasettlementwereforbidden. That is, within his other established kingdom.

Morolahun was the only son born to him. Morolahun became the first Olowu ofKuta and was blessed with five children: 
                                                                                        a female and four males from which fourruling houses have emerged up till today in Kuta. <br>
                                                                                        At the time ofAkindele’s settlement at Kuta and for many years that followed, Kuta was independent and not subordinate to any other town, not even Owu his original home.
                                                                                         The administration of the town was always in the hand of the ruler. Chieftaincies were created and the Chiefs advised the ruler as to how best the affairs of the town could be run. <br> <br>
                                                                                         At old age when Akindele Anlugbua had lived for many years but could not die, he called his people and told them that he was about to descend into the ground but that they should not forget him by making annual
                                                                                          rituals at the very spot where he descended into the ground. Furthermore, he told them that in time of war or any difficuity, they should call on him for assistance and super protection. <br><br>
                                                                                          Consequent upon this, it just happened one day, that there was a strife between two of his grandchildren. One of them was so enraged that he took a rash decision by taking a whistle and went to the top of an Ose tree to try whether Anlugbuajust made mockery of the promise he gave:hem when he was alive.
                                                                                            Calling him by his different names ofAnlugbua of Ogunforiolusere, Olominilefejewe, Okebe-kori-Omotitun, the war has come to destroy all your children.
                                                                                            Having heard this, he was hurriedly coming into the town to relief his children of their problems. On the way coming, he ordered the tree and sand by the way side to transform into human beings with guns, bows and arrows on their hands and started the mass killing of the people.
                                                                                            Anlughua later picked up the head of one of the decased only to discover that the Own tribal marks (Keke) were on the faces of the deceased ones. He immediately  
                                                                                            orderd his entourage to withdraw and go back to their respective abodes.
                                                                                            Anlugbua also went back to his abode in annoyance and has since refused to come out of the shrine. It has thereafter become an abomination for anybody with ‘Keke' tribal marks to come to his shrine. <br><br>

                            The shrine ofAnlugbua at the forest ofAnlugbua at Kuta, that is the spot where Anlugbua descended into the ground 
                            now has a mediumistic marble-rock-like monument or tombstone called ‘Apere’ with a chain coming out of the ground beside the tombstone. 
                            This chain could be pulled up to a reasonable distance while Anlugbua usually respond by pulling it back. 
                            This is normally done during his annual worship when necessary rights shall be performed at the shrine.
                            Anlugbua also astonishingly climbed up the standing tree at the shrine with the footmarks of the horse being 
                            indelibly appearing on the tree from the bottom to its apex where he hanged the “Gaari” the instrument with which
                             he used to climb and control his horse before descending into the ground. Unfortunately the historical tree was not preserved by our people. <br><br>
                             , Anlugbua also has a separate spot (shrine) for the worship of ‘Ogun’ (the god of iron) located very close to the tombstone.
                            In anut shell, the non-preservation of the historic ‘tree’not withstaning, the shrine ofAnlugbua is still really worthy of a modern tourist attraction. <br><br>

                                        The name Kuta according to oral tradition was derived from an incident that happened to Akindele and his wife. 
                                        It was said before Akindele left Ipole in searchofhis domain iwth his wife and all instruments of an Oba, 
                                        there was a terrible internal war among the people of Ipole during which so many great and brave Ozs lost their lives.
                                         It was from this war that Akindele managed to escape alongside his pregnnt wife. He thereafter congratulated himself by saying “Iku-Ta-Miti” which means “I escaped death”. 
                                        This was later abbreviated to “Kuta”
